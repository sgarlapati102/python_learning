Learning Python

Using Youtube Channel Codemy.Com

Lesson 1 - Installing Python
	1) Installed from python.org. The default download for windows was Python 3.11.4 64 bit
	2) Selected the option to add Python to windows PATH. This allows Python to be run from any dir/location
	3) Installed to C:\Users\sg102\AppData\Local\Programs\Python>
	
Lesson 2 - Using Terminals
	Windows terminals such as Command Prompt or PowerShell are limited in functionality
	We are going to get GIT Bash Terminals https://git-scm.com
	Installed GIT from https://git-scm.com/download/win 
	Installed Sublime Test from https://www.sublimetext.com
	
Lesson 3 - Hello World with Python

	Created a folder c:\srini\python_learning
	Opened Sublime Text Editor. Set View-->Syntax to Python
	Opened folder c:\srini\python_learning
	In the open file typed print("Hello World!")
	Saved the file as hello.py
	Opened GIT Bash
	cd /c/srini\python_learning and executed
	python hello.py
	We should receive "Hello World!" message
	
Lesson 4 - Commenting Code and Clearing The Screen

	Python has modules/libraries for interacting with the OS.
	For example if we wanted to clear the terminal screen, we would issue a command cls (for command prompt) or clear (For GIT BAsh Terminal)
	To clear the screen from the program, we import os modules/libraries
		import os
		os.system('clear')
		print("Hello World!!")
	
	Comments
		# is the comment syntax for commenting a line
		# I am printing Hello World!! to the screen
		print("Hello World!!")
		
		For commenting multiple lines of code use '''
		'''
			Line 1 of comments
			Line 2 of comments
			Line 3 of comments
		'''
		os.system('clear')
		
Lesson 5 - Using Variables in Python
		Variables are fundamental building blocks of programming
		Variables are containers for what you want to store
		Names your variables sensibly. If you are storing the full name of a person in a variable, call it say full_name rather than f67
		Python variables are case sensitive. So do not do camel case variable names
		
Lesson 6 - Python Datatypes

	Main Datatypes
		Strings
		Numbers
		Lists
		Tuples
		Dictionaries
		Boolean
		
	String
		Basically text in quotation marks. Single quotation or double quotation does not matter
		first_name = 'Srini' is same as first_name = "Srini"
		
	Numbers	
		age = 41 not age ="41"
		
	Lists
		Bit more complicated data type than String or Numbers
		Lists are always in square brackets
		names = ["Srini", "Archana","Smaran","Smruthi"]
		Lists numbering starts at 0. 0th item in names is "Srini"
		so names[0] is Srini, names[1] is Archana
	
	Tuples	
		Tuples are also lists but are read only.
		This makes them bit faster
		Tuples are always in round brackets
		names = ("Srini", "Archana","Smaran") --> This is a tuple. We cannot add any more members
		
	Dictionaries
		Created with Curly brackets {}
		Dictionaries are Key-Value pairs
		Key-Value pairs are separated by Commas
		Typically each Key-Value is on one line -- just a convention
		 my_family = {
	
				"father" : "Ramulu",
				"mother" : "Suguna",
				"brother": "Laxman",
				"sister" : "Jhansi",
				"wife"	:	"Archana",
				"son"	: "Smaran",
				"daughter" : "Smruthi" 
			}

			print("My father is " + my_family["father"])
					
	Boolean
		True or False
		check = True
		
		
		
Lesson 7: Python Version Control With Git and Github - #7
		
		Create a SSH Key Pair (private and public) using the bundled KeyGen tool
			in your Terminal default folder c:\users\sg102 create a .ssh folder, if it does not exist
			cd to the .ssh folder
			from this folder execute ssh-keygen.exe This is the keygen tool
			save the key id_rsa in the .ssh folder as suggested
			optionally when asked provide a passphrase. Remember the passphrase for future, or store it somewhere
			the public key id_rsa.pub and the idetification/pvt key id_rsa gets saved to the .ssh folder
			Copy the contents of id_rsa.pub to your GitHub Profile
				Log into Github -->profile-->Settings and add the Public SSH key. You may get an email about the addition
				Now your Github account has the public key that it uses to decipher data from your terminal. Your terminal
				encodes the data with the private key (id_rsa)
				
			Now its time to Initialize GIT in the folder you are working. The instructions for initializing git are at 
			http://johnelder.com/code/git.php#1
				Initializing GIT in the folder means setting up the username, email and some defaults. This is the username that gets used on the machine and folder you are 
				syncing with GIT
				Change dir to your project folder c:\srini\python_learning\
				$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
				$ git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"
				$ git config --global push.default matching
				$ git config --global alias.co checkout
				$ git init
				
				git init created a default branch called master
				
				Now add all the contents of the folder to GIT
				$ git add . 
				Now commit the files added to GIT
				$ git commit -am "Initial commit"
				
				This commits the changes to the local repository on your machine.
				To push this repository and changes to GitHub, you have to use git push command. before that you need to setup the 
				repository to which you will be pushing the files from this folder
					Log into your Github account and create a new repository python_learning. Copy its ssh path
					Add the remote repository to your directory, we are calling it "origin"
					git remote add origin git@github.com:sgarlapati102/python_learning.git
					Now push the local master brach to the remote repository  origin
					$ git push -u origin master
		

Lesson 8: Python Journaling
			As you learn a language, journal what you learn to a book. 
			Example https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Journal-John-Elder/dp/172887968X
			Or like this file itself
			
Lesson 9: Python Strings
			Strings are encased in "" or ''
			If you need to include actual double quotes in your string, then define your string with single quotes
			greeting = "My boss yelled "Get me that thing""  --> this will not print correctly, so try
			greeting = 'My boss yelled "Get me that thing"'
			or
			greeting = "My boss yelled \"Get me that thing\"" --> \ is the escape character
			
			Concatenating strings is done with a + sign.
			+ can be used only with strings
			
			Python is OOP and strings are objects. You can call methods/functions supported by the objects
			.upper(), .lower() .capitalize(), title(), .swapcase(), len(object)
